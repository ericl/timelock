This is a simple implemention of a time-lock puzzle generator and solver, as described in:

   Time-lock puzzles and timed-release Crypto (1996)
   by Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir, and David A. Wagner

Using timelock.py you can create self-decoding files that take a arbitrary amount of computational time to decode (milliseconds to centuries).

I am not a cryptographer, so this implementation should be considered only secure in theory!

Dependencies: python's Crypto library.
